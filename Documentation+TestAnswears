Test 1:
I found only one mistake - there is no check on nullptr on adding to the array, we can not expect that actors spawned with 100% chance and that it will not be destroyed during runtime

Test 3:
I randomly choose 2nd (World Interaction System) and 4th (Punching and damaging cubes) features 

Both features done by implementing interfaces for more flexibility. 

Interaction

Player can interact while standing next to the object to interact, facing it and press InteractionKey(E). When it happens player`s character casts ray forwards and if it hits object in front that implements interface invokes interaction in this objects.
Interaction with cube returns cube name
Interaction with NPC returns greetings
Because of Implementation interfaces, it is easy to expand the number of objects to interact despite of the type of object.

Attack

Attack(LMB) uses the same interface but other function that gets damage value from player and applies it to the cubes to destroy them if they health goes under 0.

What to do to polish? 

1. Add highlight for an interaction object
2. Add feedback from damaging 

Other depends on project features
